# Turkish Music Emotion Classifier

This project  is a comprehensive machine learning project meticulously designed to discern and classify the diverse emotional tones embedded within Turkish music. The dataset underpinning this endeavor boasts 400 carefully curated samples, thoughtfully distributed across four distinct emotional categories: happiness, sadness, anger, and relaxation. Each sample encapsulates a 30-second excerpt extracted from an array of Turkish music genres, spanning both vocal and instrumental compositions.

## Unveiling Emotions Through Technology

At the heart of This project  lies a pivotal objective: unraveling the intricate tapestry of emotional expressions woven into Turkish musical compositions. Leveraging sophisticated machine learning techniques, the project sets out on an exploratory journey, commencing with the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. This initial phase serves as the foundational step, facilitating the identification and categorization of emotions based on distinctive musical attributes.

## Elevating Precision Through Dimensionality Reduction

Moreover, This project  doesn't rest at mere classification; it endeavors further. Through the integration of dimensionality reduction methodologies, the project seeks to elevate the precision and efficacy of emotion classification. These techniques aim to distill essential features from the dataset, pruning away redundant or less impactful elements, thus refining the model's ability to discern nuanced emotional cues.

The subsequent classification phase following dimensionality reduction stands as a testament to the project's commitment to enhancing accuracy and efficacy in capturing the subtle emotional nuances present within Turkish music.
